# JavascriptTest

<p> Part of an interview process, I was tasked to code in vanilla JavaScript/NodeJS without the use of any 3rd party libraries or frameworks. </p>

Question 1:

Write a function called deepClone which takes an object and creates a copy of it. e.g. {name: "Paddy", address: {town: "Lerum", country: "Sweden"}} -> {name: "Paddy", address: {town: "Lerum", country: "Sweden"}}

Question 2:

We'd like to contact partners with offices within 100km of central London (coordinates 51.515419, -0.141099) to invite them out for a meal.

Write a NodeJS/JavaScript program that reads our list of partners ( download partners.json here) and outputs the company names and addresses of matching partners (with offices within 100km) sorted by company name (ascending).
